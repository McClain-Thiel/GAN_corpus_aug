# DCGAN Based Corpus Augmentation 

This is the website for a project that I and 4 other undergraduates worked on in the fall of 2019 through [Data Science Discovery program](https://data.berkeley.edu/research/discovery-program/about-discovery) at UC Berkeley. The goal of this project was to use a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to improve the performance of computer vision systems where training data is limited, particularly in medical imaging. The idea is to build a DCGAN capable of generating images similar enough to real images that we can add the fake images to the training data and the additional data will improve computer vision systems ability to recognize whatever it is that its looking for.
